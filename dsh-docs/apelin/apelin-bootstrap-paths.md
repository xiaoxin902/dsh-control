# Bootstrap paths

A jailbreak installs its files under a root that is not `/`. Code,
scripts and plists on the device run in different worlds, and a path
spelled for the wrong one points nowhere. Get this right before you
write a path.

The build tells C and Objective-C code which bootstrap it is building
for: `APELIN_BOOTSTRAP_ROOTHIDE` or `APELIN_BOOTSTRAP_ROOTLESS` is `1`
(Swift gets them as conditions). The environment section of the system
prompt names this device's bootstrap and its install root.

## The two bootstraps
- **rootless**: everything is under the fixed `/var/jb`. A package's
  dylib lives at `/var/jb/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/`,
  a tool at `/var/jb/usr/bin/`. The architecture is `iphoneos-arm64`.
- **roothide**: everything is under a folder named `.jbroot-` and
  sixteen hex digits, below `/var/containers/Bundle/Application`,
  whose name is random and **changes at every jailbreak**. There is no
  `/var/jb`. The architecture is `iphoneos-arm64e`. roothide puts a
  `.jbroot` symbolic link in each folder that holds a Mach-O, pointing
  at the current jbroot, so a binary reaches bootstrap libraries
  through `@loader_path/.jbroot/…` (the tweak extension's link stubs
  set this; you write no install names).
Because the roothide root moves, never write it down, cache it across
launches, or hard-code `/var/jb` for it (below: never store a
resolved path).

## Three worlds, three spellings
1. **Your compiled code** (the tweak, a tool) is Apple's ABI and is
   not vroot-linked, so it opens files at their real kernel path. A
   bootstrap path like `/Library/…` must be made absolute first:
   `/var/jb` + path on rootless, the jbroot + path on roothide. This
   skill's file `ApelinBootstrap.h` does exactly that (apelin_skill_read with
   that file); it is what roothide's `jbroot()` and rootless's
   `ROOT_PATH_NS()` do, written so the one source builds for both
   bootstraps. System paths — `/System`, `/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib`,
   `/var/mobile/Library/Preferences`, a container — are already real
   and are **not** converted; converting one breaks it.
2. **The bootstrap's shell and its tools** (what shell_run's `bash`,
   the terminal and a build script use on roothide) are vroot-linked:
   the jbroot is their `/`, and the real filesystem is under
   `/rootfs`. So `pwd -P`, `realpath` and `readlink` in that shell
   print `/var/mobile/…` for a path your compiler knows by the jbroot,
   and a path the shell prints is not the name to hand a compiler.
   Give the compiler relative paths or `$APELIN_PROJECT_ROOT`. On
   rootless the shell and the kernel agree (`/var/jb`).
3. **launchd and the installer** read a plist or run a script in the
   bootstrap. See the two sections below.

## In a plist (launch daemon, filter)
The packager fills two tokens, so one file serves both bootstraps:
- `@PREFIX@` — a bootstrap path's prefix: empty on roothide, `/var/jb`
  on rootless. A daemon's `Program`, `WorkingDirectory`,
  `Standard*Path`, `WatchPaths`, `QueueDirectories` and sockets under
  the bootstrap are `@PREFIX@/…`.
- `@ROOTFS@` — a system path's prefix for a key launchd rewrites:
  `/rootfs` on roothide, empty on rootless. A system directory the
  daemon watches or logs to is `@ROOTFS@/…`.
roothide's launchctl puts the jbroot in front of each of these keys
unless the path starts with `/rootfs/`, so a **system** path spelled
bare is watched, logged to or entered inside the jbroot, where it does
not exist: nothing fails and the job is never started (Xrash's
`WatchPaths`). A bootstrap path without `@PREFIX@` misses `/var/jb`
on rootless. Set `substitutePrefix: true` on the layout entry so the
packager fills the tokens. Never write a resolved jbroot or a bare
`/var/jb` into a plist.

## In a maintainer script
The installer runs it with the bootstrap's own shell: on roothide the
jbroot is its `/` (so `/var/mobile` there is the jbroot's) and the
system is under `/rootfs`; on rootless paths are `/var/jb/…`. The packager substitutes only `@PREFIX@` and `@ROOTFS@`
(and requires `sh -n` to pass), so write bootstrap paths `@PREFIX@/…`
and the few system paths you need `@ROOTFS@/…`. A link you create in a
script, or ship in the package, must be **relative**: an absolute
target resolves against the system on roothide. The packaging-and-
install skill has the rest (making mobile's folders, restarting a
daemon).

## Never store a resolved path
On roothide everything under the jbroot moves when it is renamed:
Apelin's data folder (in the jbroot's own `var/mobile`), the
project's real path, `$APELIN_PROJECT_ROOT`, `$APELIN_TOOLCHAIN_BIN`,
`SDKROOT`, every toolchain's and SDK's folder. A path read today (in
a tool's result, the environment section or a variable's value) may
be gone after the next reboot or jailbreak, so the jbroot's real
path, or any path under it, never goes into anything that outlives
the run: project files, build scripts, Makefiles, `AGENTS.md` or
`CLAUDE.md`, memory, skills, plists, package or maintainer scripts,
code. Keep the logical spelling and resolve it where it is used:
- code: `ApelinBootstrapPath(@"/Library/…")` at run time, as
  roothide's `jbroot("/Library/…")` does; never its result as a
  literal.
- a plist or maintainer script: `@PREFIX@/…`, `@ROOTFS@/…`.
- a build script or Makefile: the variables Apelin sets when it runs
  (`$APELIN_PROJECT_ROOT`, `$SDKROOT`, `$APELIN_TOOLCHAIN_BIN`, and
  for a workspace build `$APELIN_PREFIX` and `$APELIN_PACKAGE_DIR`),
  or paths relative to the project. Each is checked before it is
  used (`${APELIN_PACKAGE_DIR:?}`), since a run that did not set it
  leaves it empty; `$APELIN_PREFIX` is empty on roothide by design,
  so nothing is removed under it alone.
- a note (`AGENTS.md`, memory, a skill): the place in words or a
  variable ("the project root", "the registered iOS 17 SDK",
  `$SDKROOT`), never its path.
On rootless `/var/jb` and `/var/mobile` do not move, so nothing there
goes stale on this device; still spell paths as above, since the
project also builds for roothide, and write a bare `/var/jb` only
where the code is rootless's alone (`APELIN_BOOTSTRAP_ROOTLESS`).

## Quick rules
- Opening a bootstrap file from your own code → make it absolute with
  `ApelinBootstrap.h`'s `ApelinBootstrapPath`.
- A system file (`/var/mobile/…`, `/System/…`, a container) from your
  code → use it as it is.
- A path for a compiler, from a script → relative or
  `$APELIN_PROJECT_ROOT`, never one a bootstrap tool printed.
- A path in a plist or maintainer script → `@PREFIX@/…` or
  `@ROOTFS@/…`, `substitutePrefix: true` for a shipped file.
- Comparing two paths → canonicalise both first (`realpath`): `/var`
  and `/private/var` differ, and the jbroot may itself be a link.
- Writing a path into a file, a note or memory → its logical spelling
  or a variable, never the jbroot's real path.
